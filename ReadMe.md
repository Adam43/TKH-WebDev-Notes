# TKH Web Dev Notes Template

Hello TKH Web Development Fellows! This repo is a template for you to use to keep track of notes from class, daily reflections and helpful resources. 

How to use:
1. Fork and Clone this repo 
2. Open repo in VSC
3. For each week, duplicate the note-weekly-template.md file, and put the duplicate in the weekly folder
4. Edit dates and topic 
5. Every class day: add notes, resource links, and your daily reflection 
6. Push to Github after each day 

### üìù Keep in Mind
Your notes will be public on Github and your daily reflections will also be posted in Slack as your "exit ticket", so they should be appropriate to share with the Instructors and other fellows. They could also be good content to post on LinkedIn!


‚ùå Do not store your assignments' code in this repo. ‚úîÔ∏è You can add links to your assignment repos in your weekly notes.
